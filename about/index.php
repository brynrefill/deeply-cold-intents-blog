            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Born as a university project from the need to express opinions, reflect and talk about computer science, with a greater emphasis on <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, while maintaining an engineering approach.</p>
            <p><strong>Deeply cold intents</strong> is the metaphor that contains what comes to mind when I think that moment before something or someone does a computer action. It is that first moment in which you decide and do something, using an IT tool.</p>
            <p>The concept can be poured on both machines, cyber criminals and unaware user people.</p>
