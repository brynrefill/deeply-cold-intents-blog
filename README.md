# deeply-cold-intents-blog

This repository contains the code for a project I developed as part of the "Languages ​​and Technologies for the Web" course exam, during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer and System Engineering, where I implemented a blog with an internal content management system.

This blog has become part of my Bachelor's thesis along with its design.

### Additional Information
I have moved this project from my old account to this new one. While there is no commit history, I’ve chosen to preserve the original project to maintain the evolution of my academic work.
